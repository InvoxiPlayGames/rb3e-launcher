This is a Wii game loader designed to load Rock Band 3, RB3Enhanced, and helper
libraries, and link them all together.

Changes from base BrainSlug repo:
- Hardcoded for RB3, loads from sd:/rb3/rb3e/
- Builds out of the box with modern devkitPro
- Cleans up RAM upon launch (fixes crashes)
- Automatic exit upon failure
- Removes green flash before game launch
- Pass config INI file to RB3Enhanced, to allow functional legacy SD mode

TODO:
- Streamline source tree, remove BrainSlug channel specific cruft
- Speed up game launch by allowing hardcoded symbol table
  (possibly built into RB3Enhanced.mod binary?)
- USB game loading support built-in
- Possible nicer graphical UI while loading?
- Possible compatibility with SD-loading cIOSes?

BrainSlug Wii
    by Chadderz

BrainSlug is a specialised Wii disc loader which is designed to allow the loaded
game's functions to be patched. What sets BrainSlug apart is that the patches it
applies are not just simple copying patches, but in fact relocatable ELF files.
The idea is that a C programmer who is unfamiliar with the intricacies of
assembly code can write C code as normal and have BrainSlug take care of linking
this into the game. Thus the process of adding functionality to Wii games is
made much easier and more enjoyable for all.

The compiled code for adding modifications to the game are called BrainSlug
modules. These modules must be made in quite a specific way, so a template
module is provided in modules/template. More information about getting started
with module development can be found in modules/README.

This project is in several parts:
    bslug_include - Header files used by BrainSlug modules.
    modules       - A collection of premade BrainSlug modules.
    src           - The BrainSlug Wii channel, which actually does the patching.
    symbols       - Symbol information needed by the channel to perform linking.
    test          - Regression testing for the Wii channel.

The game's symbols are found by a simple search which is explained in
symbols/README.

See INSTALLING for information about how to install and use BrainSlug for
development purposes.

See BUILDING for information about building the channel itself.

See USAGE for information aimed at end users of the channel.

See CHANGELOG for version information.
